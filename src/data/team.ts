    bio: "I founded Pink Accounting because I saw too many business owners drowning in financial stress, not because they weren't capable, but because they didn't have the right support. My strength lies in bookkeeping, cashflow management, and building robust internal financial systems. I believe every business deserves accessible, dedicated financial expertise—not just during tax season, but every day of the year."
